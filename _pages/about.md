Hello there! 👋🏼

My name is Akhdan and I'm a **computer science student** in [Tohoku University](http://www.vision.is.tohoku.ac.jp/us/home/) under the supervision of Professors [Takayuki Okatani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gn780jcAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Masanori Suganuma](https://sites.google.com/site/suganumamasanori/eng). Previously, I studied mechanical and aerospace engineering through [FGL program](https://www.insc.tohoku.ac.jp/english/degree/undergraduate-english/) from the same university.

My research mainly explores the intersection of **machine learning** and **computer graphics**, especially on inverse rendering algorithms such as [Neural Radiance Fields](https://www.matthewtancik.com/nerf) (NeRF) and [Gaussian Splatting](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/). Beyond that, I’m also passionate in all aspects of computer vision, as well as natural language processing and their applications to life or latest technologies.

Outside of academics, I was actively volunteering at several international conferences and taking leadership roles in various organizations in and outside campus. In my spare time, I enjoy doing sports (mostly 🏃🏼 and 🏸), traveling, and photography 📸. I am fluent in English and currently learning Japanese.
